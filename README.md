# ZIO Kinesis

ZIO Kinesis is a ZIO-based wrapper around the AWS Kinesis SDK. It provides a streaming interface to Kinesis streams.

## Status

Currently a work in progress. 

Ideally this library can offer equivalent functionality of the AWS Kinesis Client Library (checkpointing and rebalancing).

## Credits

The Serde construct in this library is inspired by [zio-kafka](https://github.com/zio/zio-kafka)
